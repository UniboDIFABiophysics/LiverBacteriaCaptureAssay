# LiverBacteriaCaptureAssay

In silico model to determine the effect of the spatial localization of macrophages within a capillary network on the efficiency of bacterial capture. The capillary network simulated is that of a liver lobule, and the macrophages of interest are liver resident Kupffer cells. In this model, a 2D branching network is first simulated, made up of different vessels and strata of varying lengths. Next, this model will place macrophages in the capillary network assuming that their spatial distribution along the sinusoid was exponential (P(x) = (1/lambda)*exp(- x/lambda), where x indicates the spatial position along the sinusoid), with maximum probability near the portal vein. Finally, this model will simulate the motion of bacteria (size: 1x1 µm) through the network. Bacteria randomly enter one of the vessels and then move along the capillary network, constrained by the vessel walls. When a bacterium encounters a macrophage (i.e., bacteria overlap with a cell in the model), it is captured with a certain probability. Such probability is interpreted as the macrophage stickiness factor. If the bacterium is not stopped by the macrophage upon first encounter, but continues its trajectory over it, the probability that the bacterium may be stopped (i.e., the macrophage’s stickiness), is increased by a factor of 20%. Details of this model can be found at Gola et al., (manuscript in preparation).
